# Fed-Select
The fair-Select approach starts with the estimation of the utility of each participant based on their loss values computed on a fixed set of data samples. Then, the server determines the influence of each participant, combining it with utility values to provide a fair chance of including non-selected participants in the training process. 

Do some minor modifications in the uploaded code to run for different datasets like Cifar-10, MNIST, HAR, and Cifar-100.

This is a demo representation of the code for Fair-Select.

The uploaded Code is for Cifar-100
